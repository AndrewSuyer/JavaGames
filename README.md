# JavaGames
A collection of games and apps that I made in Java. I worked on these projects as I learned how to program in Java and use the Swing library, so some of the methods I used may be considered bad practice. Please dont judge me as a programmer based on these projects because I was still learning :). 
If you want to run any of these programs on your own computer, I recomend downloading the files and using an IDE like eclipse to run them. 

### Battleship
This is a console-based Battleship game. When coding this, I tried for follow a purely object-oriented programming style. I made lots of classes that each handled a single thing. Keeping track of all the classes proved to be quite hard, and I realized that everything would be simpler if I had a small amount of "big classes. While I do like using OOP, I think I tried to use it a little too much for this project. 

### GUI-Tutorial
I made this project to showcase the various different AWT and Swing components. I used this as a reference for when I made some of the other GUI games listed here. 

### Pong
This is one of the first games I ever made with a GUI. I followed a video tutorial for most of it, and then I went back and added my own feature: a difficulty selector. The difficulty determined how fast the ball would bounce of the paddles. I even made the ball get faster each time it bounced off a paddle.
