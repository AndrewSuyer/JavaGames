# JavaGames
A collection of games and apps that I made in Java. I worked on these projects as I learned how to program in Java and use the Swing library, so some of the methods I used may be considered bad practice. Please dont judge me as a programmer based on these projects because I was still learning :). 
If you want to run any of these programs on your own computer, I recomend downloading the files and using an IDE like eclipse to run them. 

### GUI-Tutorial
I made this project to showcase the various different AWT and Swing components
